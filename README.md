To create custom keywords per icon: 

1. Select the icon you want to edit and move it into edit-area. Resize it for better editing.


2. Turn on "constast on" layer to disable the transparent parts of the icon. This way you can write down white letters you wont see at the end.

3. Write down a keyword you want. Test if it is recognised correctly.

4. Resize icon to original size (check if keyword is still recognized correctly). To use it, copy it to your notes and set the keyword, done.
